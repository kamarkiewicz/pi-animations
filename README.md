# pi-animations

Animated thinking, working, and tool-execution indicators for [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), plus a configurable working spinner and Claude-style verbs.

Replace pi's default spinner with 21 terminal animations — from demoscene fire to Matrix rain to Pac-Man — and manage the inline spinner frames/verbs from the same extension.

## Demo

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-animations
```

### From GitHub

```bash
pi install git:github.com/arpagon/pi-animations
```

### Try without installing

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-animations
```

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpagon/pi-animations.git
pi -e ./pi-animations/animations.ts
```

Or add to `~/.pi/agent/agent.json`:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    "npm:pi-animations"
  ]
}
```

Or via git:

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    "git:github.com/arpagon/pi-animations"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Everything is under `/animation`, `/spinner`, and `/verbs`:

```
/animation                          Show status, list all animations, and help
/animation showcase                 Interactive browser (←/→ to navigate, Enter to select)
/animation <name>                   Set animation for all states
/animation working:<name>           Set working animation only
/animation thinking:<name>          Set thinking animation only
/animation tool:<name>              Set tool execution animation only
/animation width full               Full terminal width (default)
/animation width default            50 columns
/animation width <number>           Custom column count
/animation random                   Random animation each time
/animation on                       Enable animations
/animation off                      Disable animations
/spinner ...                        Frames: claude|braille|pulse|dot|star|none
/verbs ...                          Verb presets: claude|short|technical|fun|none
/verbs thinking:claude              Claude verbs only while thinking
```

`/spinner` always controls the loader icon; `/verbs` is `none` by default, can show rotating Claude-style verbs when animations are off, and can supply animated labels for text animations. Verb presets can be set globally or per phase (`thinking:`, `working:`, `tool:`).

### Example config

```
/animation thinking:aurora
/animation working:matrix3
/animation tool:fire3
/animation width full
```

### Categories

- **thinking** — shown while the model is reasoning (extended thinking phase)
- **working** — shown while the model generates a response
- **tool** — shown while tools execute (file reads, bash commands, etc.)
- **both** — suitable for any state

## How it works

### Three animation states

pi has three distinct phases during a request:

1. **Thinking** — The model reasons internally (e.g., Claude's extended thinking, OpenAI's chain-of-thought). The extension detects `thinking_start`/`thinking_end` stream events.

2. **Working** — The model generates visible text output. Detected via `agent_start`/`agent_end` events.

3. **Tool** — A tool is executing (bash, file read/write, etc.). Detected via `tool_execution_start`/`tool_execution_end` events.

Priority: **thinking > tool > working**. If the model is thinking while a tool runs, the thinking animation takes precedence.

### Rendering

- **1-line animations** use `ctx.ui.setWorkingMessage()` to replace the Loader's text inline alongside pi's braille spinner.
- **3-line animations** use `ctx.ui.setWidget()` to render a multi-line widget.
- **Thinking label** patches `AssistantMessageComponent.updateContent()` to animate the collapsed "Thinking..." text in the message body.

### Phase-aware text and verbs

Animations that display text (glitch-text, crush, shimmer, orbit-dots) automatically adapt their label:

- Thinking state → "Thinking..."
- Working state → "Working..."
- Tool state → "Running..."

Verb labels are phase-aware too. For example, use Claude-style verbs only during thinking:

```bash
/verbs thinking:claude
```

Or configure selected phases explicitly; unspecified phases are left unchanged. With a fresh config they still use the global default (`none` out of the box):

```bash
/verbs thinking:claude tool:technical
```

### Full-width rendering

Visual animations (fire, plasma, matrix, starfield, aurora, neon-bounce) scale to fill the terminal width. Structural animations (pacman, pipeline, neural-pulse) keep a fixed size.

Configurable via `/animation width`.

### Persistence

All animation + spinner settings are saved to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-tui-animations.json` and restored on startup:

```json
{
  "workingAnim": "matrix3",
  "thinkingAnim": "aurora",
  "toolAnim": "fire3",
  "width": "full",
  "randomMode": false,
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Requirements

- [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) v0.60+
- Terminal with true color (24-bit ANSI) support
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (for icon-based animations: pipeline, dev-constellation, icon-morph, pi-pulse, brainstorm)

## Development

### Standalone animation demos

Each animation has a standalone demo in `explorations/`:

```bash
bun run explorations/12-fire.ts
bun run explorations/20-crush-scramble.ts
```

Run all demos in tmux:

```bash
bash tmux-demo.sh
tmux attach -t pi-anims
# Ctrl-b n/p to navigate between windows
```

### Project structure

```
pi-animations/
├── animations.ts         Extension: 21 animations + /animation command
├── package.json
├── explorations/         Standalone animation demos (bun run)
├── tmux-demo.sh          Launch all demos in tmux
├── AGENTS.md             Agent context
└── README.md
```

### Adding a new animation

1. Add a renderer function in `animations.ts`:

```typescript
export const myAnimation: AnimationFn = (frame, width, phase?) => {
    const label = PHASE_LABELS[phase || "thinking"];
    // ... render logic using frame counter and width
    return "single line result";    // or ["line1", "line2", "line3"] for 3-line
};
```

2. Register it in the `ANIMATIONS` array:

```typescript
{ name: "my-anim", fn: myAnimation, category: "both", description: "My animation", lines: 1 },
```

3. Done — it appears in `/animation showcase` and `/animation my-anim`.
